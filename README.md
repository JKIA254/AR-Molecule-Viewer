AR Molecule Viewer

Project Overview

The AR Molecule Viewer is an augmented reality (AR) application designed to visualize molecular structures interactively. This project utilizes ARTutor for AR-based molecular visualization, allowing users to scan a QR code and view 3D molecular models.

Features

AR-Based Molecular Visualization: View 3D molecular models using ARTutor.

QR Code Integration: Scan a QR code to access the AR experience.

GitHub Pages Hosting: The project is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.

Requirements

A web browser that supports WebXR/WebGL.

ARTutor platform access.

A 3D model file (GLB format) uploaded to ARTutor.
